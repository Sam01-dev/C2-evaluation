IS-A relationship is basically known as the parent and child relationship.
When a child class inherits the properties of a parent class, it is know as a 
IS-A relationship. 

Example of IS-A relationship is as follows:

class Vehicle{
	int wheeels=4;
}

class Car extends Vehicle{
 //Here car is now a child of the Vehicle class and has inherited the 
 wheels variable.
}

Has-A relationship is basically when the perent object is referencing to the
child object. Here we can run the methods and variables of the parent object
and the overriden methods of the child object.

Example of Has-A relationship is as follows:

class Vehicle{

void run{

	sysout("I am a vehicle");
	}
}

class Bus{

void run{

sysout("I am a bus");
}
}

Vehicle vehicle = new Bus();
vehicle.run();
//Output = " I am a bus"

Access modifiers are those which help us in accessing the classes.
There are different types of access modifiers such as public, private, default,
protected.

private - private classes can be accessed only within the class and not 
			anywhere else.
			
public - public classes can be accessed by other classes as well.

default - default classes can be accessed by other classes as well. We do not 
write this term. Java compiler automatically assigns this to a class if we 
do not write a access modifier.

protected- protected class is the one which is used to build authorization 
or security based applications. the contents of the class cannot be reassigned
nor can the class name can be changed afterwards.
